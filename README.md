# Hola! 👋 I'm Sergi
## A Full Stack Dev / Software Crafter / Programmer / Whatever you wanna call it. 
I've always been interested in tech, although due to a sports injury I ended up working as a Physical Therapist. I took me a Bachelor Degree a Masters Degree, some years in the industry and a couple of existential crises to realize that I didn't want to work as a PT all my life, and persue a career in tech instead. So I enrolled to a Full Stack Web Dev at [Factoria F5](http://www.factoriaf5.org/) (in Barcelona). Best choice of my life!
</br>

I try to write clean, quality, testeable, scalable, understandeble for humans and self-explanatory code. Plz note that I said *trying*; I'm still learning. That's why I wanna dig deeper into Design Patterns, Clean Architectures and Advanced TDD. 

<br>
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Backend Architecture and DevOps </br>
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any project that I find interesting! </br>
- 🍝 I love pasta! (but hate spaghetties in my code) </br>
