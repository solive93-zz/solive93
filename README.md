# Hola! üëã I'm Sergi
## A Full Stack Dev / Software Crafter / Programmer / Whatever you wanna call it. 
I've always been interested in tech, although due to a sports injury I ended up working as a Physical Therapist. I took me a Bachelor Degree a Masters Degree, some years in the industry and a couple of existential crises to realize that I didn't want to work as a PT all my life, and persue a career in tech instead. So I enrolled to a Full Stack Web Dev at [Factoria F5](http://www.factoriaf5.org/) (in Barcelona). Best choice of my life!
</br>

I try to write clean, quality, testeable, scalable, understandeble for humans and self-explanatory code. Plz note that I said *trying*; I'm still learning. That's why I wanna dig deeper into Design Patterns, Clean Architectures and Advanced TDD. 

<br>
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning Backend Architecture and DevOps </br>
- üëØ I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on any project that I find interesting! </br>
- üçù I love pasta! (but hate spaghetties in my code) </br>

## A quick review of my repos

#### My journey in Factoria
- **/webclone**: Our first assignments in Factoria. We had to clone a landing page using ONLY semantic HTML and reusable CSS classes. Frameworks were not allowed. Check [/webclone repo](https://github.com/solive93/webclone) </br>
- **/WheelOfDoom**: Our first "Team Project". We used vanilla PHP and MySQL. The UX and the UI are... :hankey: Check [/WheelOfDoom repo](https://github.com/solive93/WheelOfDoom)
- **/MyFirstCRUD**: A 2-week-long (1 sprint), individual CRUD App. I did a very simple videogame CRUD App, but I was pretty proud of it. Check [/MyFirstCRUD repo](https://github.com/solive93/MyFirstCRUD) </br>
- **Deleted Repo**: After that first CRUD app, we had to re-do it from scratch. This time using Laravel, though. I didn't manage to implement a many-to-many relatioinship and I got a ""dependency warn" from GitHub, so I ended up deleting it. </br>
- **/KanCruz**: That was our second group project (2 sprints). We had to do a web app for a farmhouse-hotel where customers could see the availability of rooms, book them, and pets and/or breakfast (for extra cost), and display the price. The owners (admins) should be able to manage the bookings. Although I have a repon with this same name [here](https://github.com/solive93/KanCruz), the project we handled is located in [a teammate repo](https://github.com/Alejandroacho/KanCruz). </br>
- **/SudokuGo**: Our third project. In that case, we had to do a sudoku desktop app using. We came across with Wails, a Golang framework that allowes to easily build a desktop app using VueJS for the frontend. We developed a sudoku generetor/solver algorithm and we made our first steps with Vue. Check the [/SudokuGo repo](https://github.com/solive93/SudokuGo) </br>
- **/Alumni**: After the sudoku app, we mixed teams and we had to build a "huge Alumni app". Each team had to develop a feature: we had to do a Forum. The main challanges of this projects was deploying (oir first deploy), mantain and add functionality to a system that is in production, and effectively cooperate and comunicate with 4 other teams working in different functionalities within the same project. Again, we used php, laravel, mysql and Vue. I'm rebuilding our forum app in a new project [here](https://github.com/solive93/forum) but the original [Alumni repo is here](https://github.com/solive93/Alumni) </br>
- **/bank_of_time**: Next, we had 1 sprint to develop an app with Python and Flask. I tried to make system to pay services with hours intead of euros/dollars. My plan was to make an API and print the UI witth VueJS, but I hadn't enough time. This is a project I'd love to finish. Check the [/bank_of_time repo](https://github.com/solive93/bank_of_time) </br>
- **/code_talent**: Our final project! The one I enjoyed the most! We developed a system to automate the tracking of Factoria F5 Candidates course completion in Code Academy and SoloLearn. We scrapped each Candidate profile page on those 2 platforms and painted the progress in a simple dashboard, so the teachers don't have to manually check each candidate progress. It needs some refactors and improvement, and I'd like to use Vue as well, but I'm proud of that project! Check [/code_talent repo](https://github.com/solive93/code_talent) </br>
