# Hola! 👋 I'm Sergi
## A Full Stack Dev / Software Crafter / Programmer / Coder...
I'm a motivated coder, eager to learn any language/technology. I persue to become a multi-language, muli-paradigm technology.

The tech stack I feel more confortable with is PHP along with Laravel, Symfony, MySQL, some JS (JQuery, VueJS & ReactJS). Although Id'd like to work with Python due to its clean, simple syntax and its versatility. 

I try to write clean, quality, testeable, scalable, understandeble for humans and self-explanatory code. Plz note that I said *trying*; I'm still learning. That's why I wanna dig deeper into Design Patterns, Clean Architectures and Advanced TDD.

- 🍝 I love pasta! (but hate spaghetties in my code) </br>
