# Hola! 👋 I'm Sergi
### A Full Stack Dev / Software Crafter / Programmer / Whatever you wanna call it. In short, I write code (if you're on GitHub you know how it works)
I try to write clean, quality, testeable, scalable, understandeble for humans and self-explanatory code. Plz note that I said *trying*; I'm still learning. That's why I wanna dig deeper into Design Patterns, Clean Architectures and Advanced Testing.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a couple of personal Projects. They're top secret: if I told you I should kill you
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everythin. All the time  
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any project that I find interesting!
- 🍝 I love pasta! (but hate spaghetties in my code)
