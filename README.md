# Hola! 👋 I'm Sergi
## A Full Stack Dev / Software Crafter / Programmer / Whatever you wanna call it. 

I try to write clean, quality, testeable, scalable, understandeble for humans and self-explanatory code. Plz note that I said *trying*; I'm still learning. That's why I wanna dig deeper into Design Patterns, Clean Architectures and Advanced Testing. 

<br>

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Backend Architecture and DevOps
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any project that I find interesting!
- 🍝 I love pasta! (but hate spaghetties in my code)
